# Nomadic Trucker Problem: Approximate Dynamic Programming 

In the following repository I coded and analyzed the results of the nomadic trucker problem as discussed in the following [paper](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/5134989/wp_495.pdf). In particular, I analzye the single-attribute, infinite horizon case of the problem using an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach.

An overview of the problem description has been included in the Nomadic_Trucker_ADP.pdf file.
